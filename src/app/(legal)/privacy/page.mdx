## Third Party Privacy Policies

Our Privacy Policy does not apply to other websites. Thus, we are advising you to consult the respective Privacy Policies of these third-party ad servers for more detailed information. It may include their practices and instructions about how to opt-out of certain options.

You can choose to disable cookies through your individual browser options. To know more detailed information about cookie management with specific web browsers, it can be found at the browsers' respective websites.

## Cookies

Cookies are small pieces of data stored on your device by your browser. They serve various purposes, such as remembering your preferences, enhancing user experience, and facilitating authentication.

At our site, we utilize third-party authentication services, including Google OAuth, to secure and streamline the login process. When you log in using Google OAuth, a cookie is generated and stored on your device. This cookie is essential for the proper functioning of our authentication system.

The Google OAuth cookie contains a unique identifier that helps us recognize your authenticated session. It enables you to access our application seamlessly without the need to re-enter your credentials repeatedly during a single session.

It's important to note that these cookies do not store personal information directly on our servers. Instead, they serve as tokens that establish a secure connection between your browser and the authentication provider, in this case, Google. This enhances the security of the authentication process while providing a more user-friendly experience.

By using our site and opting for third-party authentication, you consent to the use of cookies for authentication purposes. You can manage your cookie preferences through your browser settings.
