/**
 * This is an example of an in memory rate limiter you can explicitly use
 * in your server actions or RSC routes.  I personally would only use it to limit
 * server actions which mutate your database or perform costly actions, such as sending out
 * invite emails.  You'd hate to have someone spam your server action and send out 1000s of emails.
 *
 * As a reminder, this type of rate limiter only works when deploying to a single VPS instance.
 * The moment you scale up, you'll need to use a distributed rate limiter such as redis (or use upstash).
 * To keep this starter kit as slim as possible, I decided to NOT require you to also
 * setup a redis instance just to launch your saas product.
